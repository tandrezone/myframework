Now the class files in the core directory have interfaces
Interfaces list the functions that the class need to  implement
Using interfaces help us avoid errors when updating the class_exists
This way we have to create the classes using the function names listed in the interfaces
We are obligued to match the function signatures and return types making less probable to make errors
